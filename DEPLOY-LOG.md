## 2026-05-24 — Session 14, PULSE-BUG-001 + MOBILE-BRIEF complete

**Commits:** a0fe5f6, 09fc30a, 8e5c67b

### PULSE-BUG-001 — all 8 bugs fixed
**Status: Deployed to GitHub main.**
**File:** `src/app/page.jsx`

- **BUG-1:** focusEans wired into rpc_top20, rpc_dept_summary, rpc_kpi_dept_counts — Focus Area basket now actually filters all data panels
- **BUG-2:** Cancellation flag on rpc_focus_top5 auto-populate effect — prevents race condition overwriting manual basket
- **BUG-3:** normalizeDept() applied before dept_name comparisons in kpiNegSOH + kpiSlowMove (dotted names e.g. GROCERIES.FOODS now match)
- **BUG-4:** KPI useMemos now branch on subDeptFilter using pre-filtered deptSummary/deptSohCounts — KPI strip responds to sub-dept filter
- **BUG-5:** clearStoreSelection sets [] not ALL_STORE_CODES (was a no-op)
- **BUG-6:** fetchAllRows capped at 10,000 rows — prevents 17+ RPC calls on large multi-store multi-date sets
- **BUG-7:** slowmovers + negsoh KPI cards now have onClick (open drawer), matching the reorder card
- **BUG-8:** activeProducts gives selectedProduct priority over focusBasket; top20 useMemo skips filter for non_movers; handleClose corrected

### MOBILE-BRIEF — all 17 items + critical bugs
**Status: Deployed to GitHub main.**
**Files:** `src/app/layout.jsx`, `src/app/dashboard.css`, `src/app/page.jsx`, `src/components/ProductDetailPanel.jsx`, `src/components/PushStatusStrip.jsx`

- Viewport meta tag (layout.jsx)

## 2026-05-24 — Session 12, v3.7 + Block 8 complete

**Commit:** dcc7667

### Push script v3.7 (Block 8 Step 12)
**Status: Pushed to GitHub main. Self-updater deploys tonight.**
**Files:** `scripts/Push-SigmaToSupabase.ps1`

**push_log enrichment:** `Complete-PushLog` now writes `snapshot_date`, `rows_expected`,
`tac_filename`, `duration_seconds` on every push_log update.

**PARTIAL status:** When `rows_pushed > 0 AND rows_failed > 0`, status is `PARTIAL` (not SUCCESS).
Full failure stays `FAILED`. Zero failures stays `SUCCESS`.

**Both nightly and backfill** modes updated with timing + new columns.

### Block 8 SQL files (all run in Supabase)
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step5_push_log_migration.sql` — push_log 4 new columns + index
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step6_push_errors.sql` — push_errors snapshot_date added
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step7_orders.sql` — orders shell
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step8_product_aliases.sql` — product_aliases shell
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step9_user_profiles.sql` — user_profiles shell (RLS, no policies)
- `sql/sb_sch_001_step10_audit_log.sql` — audit_log shell
- `sql/sb_ret_001_purge_function.sql` — purge_old_snapshots() + pg_cron job id=4
- `sql/sb_rhy_001_mini_payday_seed.sql` — 5th community_rhythm profile (Mini-payday, 13-16, x1.10)

## 2026-05-23 — Session 11, v3.6 + SQL

**Commit:** 93a587a

### Push script v3.6 + upsert_search_index delta (Push script + SQL)
**Status: Script committed. SQL pending Pieter running upsert_search_index_delta.sql in Supabase.**
**Files:** `scripts/Push-SigmaToSupabase.ps1`, `sql/upsert_search_index_delta.sql`

**NULL-date guard:** `Test-IsoDate` validates snapshot_date extracted from each TAC zip before
any rows are pushed. Invalid date writes FAILED to push_log and aborts that date cleanly.
Applies in both nightly and backfill modes.

**Delta search index:** `upsert_search_index` now accepts optional `p_snapshot_date date`.
Nightly mode passes today's date -- only re-indexes EANs seen in today's push (fast).
Backfill mode passes nothing -- full rebuild (existing behaviour).
Self-updater will deploy v3.6 to all 5 servers on next nightly push (after SQL runs).

**How to verify:** Check push_log output tomorrow morning -- search_index line should show
"delta YYYY-MM-DD" not "full rebuild".

## 2026-05-23 — Session 11, Bug Fix

**Commit:** 92f6a78

### upsert_search_index — null last_seen on dormant products (SQL)
**Status: Deployed and verified in Supabase**
**File:** `sql/fix_upsert_search_index_null_last_seen.sql`

Root cause: dormant/placeholder products in daily_snapshots have snapshot_date IS NULL.
MAX(snapshot_date) over an all-NULL group returns NULL, which violated the NOT NULL
constraint on product_search_index.last_seen. GREATEST(existing, NULL) also returns NULL
on the conflict-update path, making it hit even for existing rows.

Fix: added `AND snapshot_date IS NOT NULL` to the WHERE clause in upsert_search_index.
Products with no valid snapshot date are excluded from the search index.

Verified: SELECT upsert_search_index('80579') ran without error and returned NULL (void).

## 2026-05-21 — Session 2, Batch 3

**Commits:** pending push after this entry

### Issue 1 — rpc_dept_summary + rpc_kpi_dept_counts 18-second regression (SQL)
**Status: Deployed and verified in Supabase**
**File:** `sql/fix_index_rule_dept_rpcs.sql`

Root cause: `snapshot_date::text = ANY(p_dates)` in both functions. Casting the column
to text prevents PostgreSQL from using the snapshot_date index on the 10.4M-row
daily_snapshots table. Has been in every version since add_ean_filter.sql; became
noticeable as the table grew.

Fix: `snapshot_date = ANY(p_dates::date[])` — cast the parameter array, not the column.
Both functions dropped (CASCADE, no signature) and recreated clean with correct rule.
After running, Sales by Department should load in under 3 seconds.

### Issue 2 — Search: stale closure caused incorrect RPC params (Frontend)
**Status: Deployed in this batch**

Root cause: `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, and `deptNormMap` were used inside the
ProductSearchBar debounce effect but were NOT in its deps array. On switching from a
specific dept (populated local index) to All Depts, the effect re-ran with stale
dept-filter values. The RPC was called with wrong `p_dept_names` (showing results
filtered to the previous dept). Also missing effect cleanup (timer not cleared on unmount).

Fix:
- Added `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, `deptNormMap` to the useEffect deps array
- Added `return () => { if (timerRef.current) clearTimeout(timerRef.current) }` cleanup

To confirm: type 3+ chars in the search box with All Depts + All Stores selected.
A POST to `rpc_search_products` must appear in the network tab within 400ms of
the last keystroke.

### Issue 3 — Bug 7: Reorder Items KPI card onClick not wired
**Status: Already fixed in commit 80b681c (previous batch)**

The `onClick` is correctly wired to the card div and calls
`setCurrentReport('reorder'); setDrawerOpen(true); if (!reportLoaded && !reportLoading) loadReport()`.
The sub-label "Open report drawer" is styled teal/underlined when the onClick exists.
PM's report was based on a pre-fix version.

To confirm: click anywhere on the Reorder Items KPI card — the Reports & Downloads
drawer must slide open with Reorder List pre-selected.

### Issue 4 — Top 20 button layout: two rows instead of one coherent group (Frontend)
**Status: Deployed in this batch**

Root cause: By Qty/By Value toggle and Movers/Non-Movers toggle were rendered in two
separate `<div>` rows with `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` on the second. Looked broken —
the two controls were visually disconnected.

Fix: Collapsed to a single flex row in the panel header. Title on the left; on the right,
both pill-groups sit inline with a 1px vertical divider (height 14, rgba(255,255,255,0.12))
between them. Layout: `[By Qty][By Value] | [Movers][Non-Movers]`.

To confirm: Top 20 Movers panel header shows title on left and both toggle groups on the
right as one inline control bar separated by a thin vertical rule.

### Issue 5 — Non-Movers definition wrong (SQL)
**Status v1: Deployed but broken — superseded by v2**
**Status v2: Deployed and verified in Supabase**
**File v2:** `sql/fix_non_movers_v2.sql`

v1 root cause (fix_non_movers_definition.sql): two bugs discovered after deploy:
  1. last_sales_date_iso is a DATE column, not text. NULLIF(col, '') on a date column
     fails silently in plpgsql — returned zero rows instead of an error.
  2. period_qty = 0 (Sigma month-to-date) is the wrong metric for "no sales in 4 weeks".
     A product that sold on the 1st shows period_qty > 0 even if it hasn't moved since.

v2 definition (per PM brief — ROS > 0, no sales 4 weeks, SOH > 0, sold within 1 year):
  Replaces both conditions with a single BETWEEN on the DATE column:
    last_sales_date_iso BETWEEN (CURRENT_DATE - 365 days) AND (CURRENT_DATE - 28 days)
  NULL last_sales_date_iso rows (never sold) are excluded automatically by BETWEEN.
  Diagnostic confirmed 1,336,612 qualifying rows across all stores.

Movers branch is unchanged. Signature unchanged (still 7 params).
