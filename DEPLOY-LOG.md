## 2026-05-21 — Session 2, Batch 3

**Commits:** pending push after this entry

### Issue 1 — rpc_dept_summary + rpc_kpi_dept_counts 18-second regression (SQL)
**Status: Deployed and verified in Supabase**
**File:** `sql/fix_index_rule_dept_rpcs.sql`

Root cause: `snapshot_date::text = ANY(p_dates)` in both functions. Casting the column
to text prevents PostgreSQL from using the snapshot_date index on the 10.4M-row
daily_snapshots table. Has been in every version since add_ean_filter.sql; became
noticeable as the table grew.

Fix: `snapshot_date = ANY(p_dates::date[])` — cast the parameter array, not the column.
Both functions dropped (CASCADE, no signature) and recreated clean with correct rule.
After running, Sales by Department should load in under 3 seconds.

### Issue 2 — Search: stale closure caused incorrect RPC params (Frontend)
**Status: Deployed in this batch**

Root cause: `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, and `deptNormMap` were used inside the
ProductSearchBar debounce effect but were NOT in its deps array. On switching from a
specific dept (populated local index) to All Depts, the effect re-ran with stale
dept-filter values. The RPC was called with wrong `p_dept_names` (showing results
filtered to the previous dept). Also missing effect cleanup (timer not cleared on unmount).

Fix:
- Added `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, `deptNormMap` to the useEffect deps array
- Added `return () => { if (timerRef.current) clearTimeout(timerRef.current) }` cleanup

To confirm: type 3+ chars in the search box with All Depts + All Stores selected.
A POST to `rpc_search_products` must appear in the network tab within 400ms of
the last keystroke.

### Issue 3 — Bug 7: Reorder Items KPI card onClick not wired
**Status: Already fixed in commit 80b681c (previous batch)**

The `onClick` is correctly wired to the card div and calls
`setCurrentReport('reorder'); setDrawerOpen(true); if (!reportLoaded && !reportLoading) loadReport()`.
The sub-label "Open report drawer" is styled teal/underlined when the onClick exists.
PM's report was based on a pre-fix version.

To confirm: click anywhere on the Reorder Items KPI card — the Reports & Downloads
drawer must slide open with Reorder List pre-selected.

### Issue 4 — Top 20 button layout: two rows instead of one coherent group (Frontend)
**Status: Deployed in this batch**

Root cause: By Qty/By Value toggle and Movers/Non-Movers toggle were rendered in two
separate `<div>` rows with `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` on the second. Looked broken —
the two controls were visually disconnected.

Fix: Collapsed to a single flex row in the panel header. Title on the left; on the right,
both pill-groups sit inline with a 1px vertical divider (height 14, rgba(255,255,255,0.12))
between them. Layout: `[By Qty][By Value] | [Movers][Non-Movers]`.

To confirm: Top 20 Movers panel header shows title on left and both toggle groups on the
right as one inline control bar separated by a thin vertical rule.

### Issue 5 — Non-Movers definition wrong (SQL)
**Status: Deployed and verified in Supabase**
**File:** `sql/fix_non_movers_definition.sql`

Root cause: The non_movers branch of `rpc_top20` filtered on `soh > 0 AND period_qty = 0`
only. This included every zero-selling in-stock product including true dead stock and
catalogue stubs that have never sold. Not actionable for a store manager.

Fix: Added `NULLIF(s.last_sales_date_iso, '')::date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '365 days')`
to the non_movers WHERE clause. NULLIF handles empty strings (avoids cast error). Only
products that have sold at least once in the last 365 days are included — recently active
items that have since stalled. These are actionable.

Movers branch is unchanged. Function signature unchanged (still 7 params).
After running, Non-Movers mode should show a materially shorter, more focused list.
