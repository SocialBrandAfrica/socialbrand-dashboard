**Commits:** pending push after this entry

### Issue 1 — rpc_dept_summary + rpc_kpi_dept_counts 18-second regression (SQL)
**Status: SQL file written — must be run in Supabase SQL Editor**
**File:** `sql/fix_index_rule_dept_rpcs.sql`

Root cause: `snapshot_date::text = ANY(p_dates)` in both functions. Casting the column
to text prevents PostgreSQL from using the snapshot_date index on the 10.4M-row
daily_snapshots table. Has been in every version since add_ean_filter.sql; became
noticeable as the table grew.

Fix: `snapshot_date = ANY(p_dates::date[])` — cast the parameter array, not the column.
Both functions dropped (CASCADE, no signature) and recreated clean with correct rule.
After running, Sales by Department should load in under 3 seconds.

### Issue 2 — Search: stale closure caused incorrect RPC params (Frontend)
**Status: Deployed in this batch**

Root cause: `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, and `deptNormMap` were used inside the
ProductSearchBar debounce effect but were NOT in its deps array. On switching from a
specific dept (populated local index) to All Depts, the effect re-ran with stale
dept-filter values. The RPC was called with wrong `p_dept_names` (showing results
filtered to the previous dept). Also missing effect cleanup (timer not cleared on unmount).

Fix:
- Added `deptFilter`, `subDeptFilter`, `deptNormMap` to the useEffect deps array
- Added `return () => { if (timerRef.current) clearTimeout(timerRef.current) }` cleanup

To confirm: type 3+ chars in the search box with All Depts + All Stores selected.
A POST to `rpc_search_products` must appear in the network tab within 400ms of
the last keystroke.

### Issue 3 — Bug 7: Reorder Items KPI card onClick not wired
**Status: Already fixed in commit 80b681c (previous batch)**

The `onClick` is correctly wired to the card div and calls
`setCurrentReport('reorder'); setDrawerOpen(true); if (!reportLoaded && !reportLoading) loadReport()`.
The sub-label "Open report drawer" is styled teal/underlined when the onClick exists.
PM's report was based on a pre-fix version.

To confirm: click anywhere on the Reorder Items KPI card — the Reports & Downloads
drawer must slide open with Reorder List pre-selected.
